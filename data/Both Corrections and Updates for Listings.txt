Corrections and Updates for Listings and Project
________________
Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to establish clear procedures and responsibilities for managing corrections, updates, and verifications of property listings and project information received from the Bayut and dubizzle Content Teams. This ensures data accuracy, consistency, and compliance with brand and platform standards, while maintaining seamless coordination with the Operations Team for final implementation.
Scope:
* Verify and correct data related to property listings, developers, and projects across both Bayut and dubizzle platforms.
* Ensure all updates are factually accurate, aligned with brand guidelines, and consistent across English and Arabic versions.
* Facilitate smooth communication and coordination with the Operations Team for technical updates or backend changes.
* Maintain documentation and tracking of all edits, requests, and resolutions.
Responsibilities:
Content Team (Bayut & dubizzle):
* Submit listing and project correction requests through the established channel on Slack.
* Provide supporting details such as URLs, screenshots, or references for each correction request.
* Validate factual accuracy (developer names, locations, payment plans, handover dates, etc.) before submission.
* Review and approve content corrections once they have been implemented.
Operations Team:
* Execute approved corrections and updates within the backend system.
* Ensure data synchronisation across English and Arabic listings.
* Notify the content team once the update is completed for verification.
Coordination Lead (Channel Handler):
* Serve as the main liaison between the Content and Operations teams.
* Review all incoming requests to ensure completeness and accuracy before escalation.

   * Description of the issue
   * Required correction (English / Arabic)
   * Source or reference (official website, Bayut database, etc.)
   2. Initial Review
   * The channel handler reviews requests for completeness and verifies data before sending to Operations.
   * Incomplete or unclear requests are returned to the submitting team for clarification.
   3. Operations Implementation
   * The Operations team updates the listings, project details, or metadata based on the approved correction request.
   4. Quality Assurance (QA)
   * Once updates are completed, the channel handler verifies the changes live on the platform.
   * If discrepancies persist, a follow-up correction request is submitted.
   5. Closure & Tracking
   * Each completed request is logged in the tracking sheet with timestamps and status.
   * Periodic audits are conducted to ensure all data remains accurate and consistent.
Frequency:
   * Number of corrections processed per week/month: Varies daily 
   * Average resolution time per request: 10 to 15 minutes to check the data and send the request; sometimes it takes longer for complicated issues.
