Algolia Locations SOP
  

This SOP outlines the steps for adding Algolia Locations to articles, verifying that older articles have locations added in WordPress, and ensuring that all articles are ready for migration to the Strapi system.
Purpose
The purpose of this SOP is to ensure that all published blog articles have accurate Algolia Location tags added.
Scope
This process covers:
* All published articles in WordPress
* Both new and existing articles require location verification
This process does not cover:
* Unpublished or draft articles
* Articles hosted outside of WordPress (e.g., test or training environments)
* Articles that do not require Algolia Location tags (Such as discussion articles and those that cover the entire UAE rather than a specific emirate)
Responsibilities
* Sub-editor:
   * Ensures every article has an assigned Algolia Location and updates the tracking sheet accordingly
* Content Team:
   * Adds locations to newly published articles
